        "text": "Before leaving the Shire, Bilbo Baggins left his entire estate at Bag End to his nephew, Frodo, including the magic ring he discovered on his adventure. After his uncle’s departure, Frodo was visited by the wizard, Gandalf, who suspected that Bilbo’s ring was in fact The Master Ring forged by the Dark Lord Sauron for the dominion of Middle-earth. When Gandalf threw the ring into Frodo’s fireplace, ancient runes appeared on the band that confirmed it was indeed The One Ring, an ancient and indestructible evil. Knowing that servants of the Enemy would be searching for the Ring, Gandalf told Frodo he must leave the Shire and take the Ring to Elrond in Rivendell. He advised Frodo to sell Bag End and act as if he were moving to Buckland to avoid drawing suspicion before the wizard himself left to seek help. ",
